A simple game of Rock, Paper and Scissors using HTML, beautifying it by CSS and making it interactive uing JavaScript. 
You can also use shortcuts to playt the game like:
You can click 'r' for playing Rock,
'p' for Paper,
and 's' for Scissors.
There is also a reset button which you can also use by clickip 'x' key.
I have also added a AutoPlay button which on clicking keeps the game running until you manually stop it.
Thank You for reading!
